# Hangman #

Simple Hangman game with a state based screen system. The user could choose to create a dictionary of words or use the hard-coded dictionary to play. The user can export the dictionary for use again and add to the file outside of the application.

This was a small project made for one of the bootcamp challenges set by Bournemouth University. We worked in small teams with each person working on different challenges.
